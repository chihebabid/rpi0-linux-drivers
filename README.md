# Linux Device Drivers Development Labs

This repository contains a set of hands-on labs designed to teach **Linux device driver development** on a **Raspberry Pi Zero** running **Linux kernel version 6.12**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- The repository is organized into folders.
- Each folder corresponds to a specific device driver lab.
- Some labs include multiple versions of a driver to demonstrate incremental development or alternative approaches.

## 🧪 Tested Environment

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi Zero
- **Kernel version**: Linux 6.12

## 🎯 Objectives

These labs aim to provide a practical, step-by-step introduction to:

- Writing and compiling Linux kernel modules
- Interfacing with hardware using platform drivers
- Managing GPIOs using the `gpiod` API
- Using the Device Tree to describe hardware
- Debugging and testing drivers on embedded systems

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start working with the labs:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chihebabid/Linux-Device-Drivers-Development-Labs.git
